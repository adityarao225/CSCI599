This is done by calculating the amount of light that reaches each point on the model and then using that information to create a realistic image.\n","\n","* Rasterizer: Rasterization is a core computer graphics process used to convert vector graphics (which include geometric shapes like lines, triangles, and polygons) into a raster image (pixels or dots) for display on a screen or for printing. [Camera and Objects](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=camera#webgl_camera)\n","* Ray tracer: Ray tracing is a technique that simulates the way light rays interact with surfaces to produce images. It traces the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulates the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. The basic process involves shooting rays from the eye (camera) to each pixel on the screen, calculating the intersection with objects in the scene, and then, for each visible surface, tracing more rays to light sources to calculate shading (this may include shadows, reflections, and refractions).  [Ray Caster Demo](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=ray#webgl_raycaster_bvh)\n","* Path tracer: Path tracing is an extension of the ray tracing algorithm that uses Monte Carlo methods to simulate light paths more comprehensively. Instead of explicitly tracing rays directly to light sources for each intersection (as in traditional ray tracing), path tracing randomly samples paths through the scene, bouncing off surfaces until they either reach a light source or are absorbed by the material they hit. This process is repeated many times per pixel, and the color of each pixel is the average of all the samples. Path tracing can more accurately simulate a wide range of lighting phenomena, including indirect light (diffuse interreflection), caustics (focused light, like the bright patterns at the bottom of a swimming pool), soft shadows, and the subtleties of materials more naturally.

It can be used to create a variety of effects, such as:\n","\n","* Creating shadows\n","* Highlighting certain features of the model\n","* Creating a sense of atmosphere\n","\n","There are a variety of different lighting techniques that can be used in rendering, such as:\n","\n","* **Ambient lighting:** This type of lighting is used to simulate the general level of light in a scene.\n","* **Directional lighting:** This type of lighting comes from a specific direction, such as the sun. [Directional Light Demo](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=light#webgl_lights_hemisphere)\n","* **Point lighting:** This type of lighting comes from a single point, such as a light bulb. [Point Light Demo](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=light#webgl_lights_pointlights)\n","* **Spot lighting:** This type of lighting comes from a small area, such as a flashlight.

For example, a shiny material will reflect more light than a dull material.\n","\n","There are a variety of different materials that can be used in rendering, such as:\n","\n","* **Metals:** Metals are shiny and reflective.\n","* **Plastics:** Plastics are typically dull and non-reflective.\n","* **Wood:** Wood is a natural material that can vary in appearance depending on the type of wood.\n","* **Glass:** Glass is transparent and can be used to create realistic reflections and refractions.\n","\n","What's the difference between these materials? Textures and Reflectance Properties\n","\n","* **Textures:** A texture is a 2D image (even 1D and 3D textures exist) used to add detail to an object; think of a texture as a piece of paper with a nice brick image (for example) on it neatly folded over your 3D house so it looks like your house has a stone exterior. Because we can insert a lot of detail in a single image, we can give the illusion the object is extremely detailed without having to specify extra vertices.
